# tri-modal-decomp

A **pure-Python** collection of simple scripts (no MPI, minimal dependencies) for extracting coherent flow structures via modal decompositions:

- **Bispectral Mode Decomposition (BSMD)**  
  Extracts third-order phase-coupled spatial modes by diagonalizing an estimated bispectral density tensor, revealing the triadic interactions that drive nonlinear energy transfer.

- **Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD)**  
  Solves the cross-spectral density eigenvalue problem to yield energy-ranked, harmonic spatial modes under the assumption of wide-sense stationarity.

- **Space-Time Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (ST-POD)**  
  Generalizes POD to a full space‚Äìtime framework by solving the 4-D Fredholm eigenproblem of the space-time correlation tensor, capturing arbitrary nonstationary and transient dynamics over finite windows.
